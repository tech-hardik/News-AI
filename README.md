# News-AI
An app that uses Sentiment Analysis ( Create ML ) to seperate good and bad news. Made in SwiftUI. Also contains Dummy In-App Purchases, Search Functionality for specific topics.

# Note & How to run on your device
It was trained on a really small data set from Kaggle so it might be inaccurate sometimes. You have to train your own ML Model in CreateML and add it to your XCode Project if you wish to clone and run it on your own device.
